#Algorithm to calculate a running sum
A user will enter numbers that will be added to the sum 
and when a negative number is encountered, 
stop adding numbers and write out the final result.

- Set running_sum = 0
- Prompt user to add number, n
- WHILE n>0:
    - runningsum = n + running_sum
    - prompt for user input and continue cycle

    - IF n < 0, 
        - Print running_sum
